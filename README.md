Hunting HFR for signals


Steps:  
1. Assemble data  
 i. MER - Q1 API  
 ii. HFR - download and stich 2020.1, 2020.2, 2020.3. 2020.4
1. Determine denominator (TX_CURR)
  i. FY20 FY target  
  ii. FY20 Q1 results  
1. Flag sites as high volume or not  
 i. High volume = sites that represent ~80% of the TX_CURR denominator
1. COMPLETNESS: What percent of the denominator do we have  
 i. High volume, low volume
 ii. Site and volume
 ii. (viz that represents both vol of a site and it's % of HFR completness)  
1. CORRECTNESS: What % of MER data is represented by HFR data for the same period  
 i. High volume, low volume
 ii. By mechanism, by country  
1. Trends in completness and correctness
