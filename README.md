Hunting HFR for signals


Steps:  
1. Assemble data  
   * MER - Q1 API  
   * HFR - download and stich 2020.1, 2020.2, 2020.3. 2020.4
1. Determine denominator (TX_CURR)
   * FY20 FY target  
   * FY20 Q1 results  
1. Flag sites as high volume or not  
  * High volume = sites that represent ~80% of the TX_CURR denominator
1. COMPLETNESS: What percent of the denominator do we have  
  * High volume, low volume
  * Site and volume
  * (viz that represents both vol of a site and it's % of HFR completness)  
1. CORRECTNESS: What % of MER data is represented by HFR data for the same period  
  * High volume, low volume
  * By mechanism, by country  
1. Trends in completness and correctness
