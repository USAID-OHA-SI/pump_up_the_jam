### Data

The following files are the data sources used for this project. Due to sensitivity around sharing, PEPFAR data cannot be stored publically. 

 - [HFR_DATIM_FY20Q1.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D0WFOLZJb4kMPpgiqGCIc-G_lT1tWJ21) - Zipped file that contains all the FY20Q1 data from DATIM API. Data files are stored by mechanism. The files were downloaded from Google Drive where they are stored and the folder renamed.
 - [HFR_FY20_GLOBAL_mechanisms_20200306.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Au6MTGnnmpsBdWfQRt1WTetV-KaZot48) - Global list of mechanism accessed from DATIM via API
 - [HFR_FY20_GLOBAL_orghierarchy_20200306.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Au6MTGnnmpsBdWfQRt1WTetV-KaZot48) - Global organizational hierarchy accessed from DATIM via API
 - [HFR_2020_inprocess_20200211.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14BKYe3cwLF59f035n7cDKAby2GIU-zlB) - zipped file that contains the adjusted HFR data from periods 2020.01-2020.04 (essentially FY20Q1). Due to issues with the server, the file was largely contructed locally to feed into the Tableau report for 2020.04.
